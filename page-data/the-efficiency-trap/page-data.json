Whether it is to get that next promotion or bonus, we work harder and Google the best tips on how to work more efficiently. There is an avalanche of information you can find online about how to work more efficiently, including such tips as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep track of your time</li>\n<li>Take breaks</li>\n<li>Limit distractions</li>\n<li>Finish what you start, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Excitedly, you begin to implement some or all of the tips you find online. After a week or two, you feel like you've never been more efficient. You keep this up for several weeks and months. And yet, while you are completing tasks faster than ever before, you don't seem to be any closer to your real goals or moving the needle in your business or project in a meaningful way. Why is that?</p>\n<p>You've fallen into the efficiency trap.</p>\n<p>Working more efficiently can get more things on your todo list done in a faster time, but what does it matter if the items on your list aren't impactful?</p>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>My definition of impact is a set of actions you have taken, which led to results. An impactful action is, therefore, one that you have made, which has led to the real results you are seeking. It can be hard to distinguish which actions are impactful versus those that aren't, but a simple test is to view the absence. If you had not performed that action, would the results have still happened? If the answer is yes, then the action was not impactful.\nTherefore increasing impact is the focus. That has a direct correlation to the results we are hoping to achieve.\nIf I take 100 actions, and only one of those actions leads to results, it doesn't matter how fast I complete the other 99. I can be the most efficient person in the world at completing those other 99 tasks, but it won't matter one bit to my impact.</p>\n<h2>Working Effectively</h2>\n<p>A better goal than working more efficiently is to work more effectively. Being effective means getting the results with the least amount of actions. An effective person may not be the fastest or more efficient at completing the tasks they set out to do, but they make sure the jobs they work on have an impact.\nConsider the following diagram:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/effective.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If my goal is to get from A to B in the above example, the most effective way is to do the actions that get me on the straight line to B. It doesn't matter how efficient I am on the ineffective path, it won't have as much impact as the straight line will.\nA lot of people fall into the trap of optimizing working more efficiently along the ineffective path. Or worse, they put in more and more hours thinking that will solve their problem.</p>\n<p>The solution here seems quite simple, don't work on the actions that don't lead to results, right?</p>\n<h2>Focus on what matters</h2>\n<p>The problem is that most of the time, you can't know for sure which actions will lead to the results you want.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you do know right away. There are certain actions that you need to do, which don't have any impact. Types of actions are a tax and you should work to minimize the time investment they require or eliminate them. Some examples of these would be filing expense reports, waiting for your computer to update, most meetings, etc. Do not work on these tasks during the time you usually are the most productive. A good rule of thumb is to batch these tasks to do at a specific time each week, whenever you normally find it hard to concentrate on other work.</p>\n<p>And now I will give some examples on how to distinguish whether a task will lead to impact. My experience is in software engineering, but you can think about the actions in your life/career and apply similar questions.</p>\n<h3>What problem am I trying to solve?</h3>\n<p>This question has saved me countless hours of working on pointless tasks. Whenever I am about to spend a significant part of my day working on some task, I will ask myself this question. I see a lot of junior engineers spend way too much time trying to solve problems that don't matter. It's great that they found a solution to an edge case that is unlikely to happen, but we need to make the main functionality work first!</p>\n<h3>Solve the problem you have today</h3>\n<p>I find a lot of software engineers have this tendency to build software architectures that can handle every possible scenario. This often leads to overly complex code with lots of abstractions and lots of bugs. It is very hard to reason about changes to that codebase. When asked why they are making it so complex, they will answer that this is the best way to ensure the system will handle the requirements and scale of the future. But why would we spend valuable time now trying to improve our product to scale to millions of customers, when we don't even have a single customer today? Solve the problem that you are facing today, leave tomorrow's problems for tomorrow.</p>\n<p>There is a caveat to this point though. While solving today’s problems will make the product managers and the business people happy, this should be balanced with tackling the engineering debt in the system. Focus too much on solving today’s problems and you will spend a lot of your future time reacting to engineering problems that could have been avoided.</p>\n<h3>Add value to the people who will ultimately benefit</h3>\n<p>If you are having trouble figuring out what matters, another way to look at it is how you can add value to the people who will eventually benefit from your effort?\nAs a software engineer, adding value to your end-users is what matters. This can be in the form of new features, increased reliability, increased performance, fixed bugs etc. If you can’t tie the work you are doing to some improvement to the end-user experience, you should question the value of that action.</p>\n<h3>Embrace simplicity</h3>\n<p>Simplicity is a topic that deserves a dedicated post, but I'll touch briefly on the basics here. The more complex a software system, the harder it is to understand how a specific code change will lead to a result. The most complex systems often become nearly impossible to make changes to, due to the risk of a regression. Simpler systems are easier to make changes to, which means you can deliver value to your customers faster and more reliably on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p>Simplicity is also necessary on the customer experience side. Oftentimes, engineers justify adding complexity by saying their customers need \"flexibility.\" They think their customers need the thousands of options that their systems provide to tweak it exactly to their liking. Then when something goes wrong, it often becomes impossible to diagnose what is going on because no one else has that same set of options configured. The pre-iPhone smartphone era is a perfect example of this. Smartphone makers thought that customers wanted lots of options on how to customize their experience when all they wanted was a simple experience that Just Worked.</p>\n<h2>Escaping the trap</h2>\n<p>Now that you've seen the efficiency trap for what it is, you can start taking steps to escape from it (or avoid it altogether). Having more impact is the goal, and working more effectively by focusing on what matters is the way to get to the outcomes you want. So remember the next time you sit down to do some work, what problem are you trying to solve?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Efficiency Trap"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/the-efficiency-trap","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/why-korea","title":"Why Did You Choose to Move to Korea?","tags":["blog","korea"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/the-best-of-hard-code","title":"The best of Eric Brechner’s “Hard Code”","tags":["blog","engineering"]}}}}}
